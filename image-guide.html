		    <h3><u>IMAGE TYPES</u><h3>
			
			  <h4><u>JPEG (JOINT PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPERTS GROUP)</u></h4>
			   <p> Developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group, this filetype(.jpg) is the Standard
			   for Professional Photographers. JPG's comress image data into blocks of pixels. Compressing makes
			   the image load faster, however, it is permanent so it degrades with every save.  It should be used 
			   whenever saving images with many different colors. </p>
		  
			   
			  <h4><u>PNG (PORTABLE NETWORK GRAPHICS)</u></h4>
			  <p> Filetypes ending in .png are are used almost exclusively for web images.  It is not used for print images
			  because it creates a larger file. This filetype is good for images with text and art.  While not as good as JPEG,
			  it compresses better, but works best with flat colors or images with large areas filled with the same color.</p>
			  
			  <h4><u>GIF (GRAPHIC INTERCHANGE FORMAT)</u></h4>
			  <p> Filetypes ending in .gif have an extremely limited range of colors.  This format will compress images without
			  losing detail like JPEG, but it cannot be made as small. GIF's are never used for photography due to the limited 
			  number of colors but can be used for web images and animation.</p>
			
			<h3><u>Image Optimization and Naming Tips</u></h3>
				<ul>
				  <li> Save images in the correct format - The wrong format can cause slow web page loading and unclear images</li>
				  <li> Save images at the right size - Save at the same size as it will appear on the website</li>
				  <li> Measure images in pixels - Measure width and height in pixels, not centimeters or inches</li>
				  <li> Cropping Images - Important not to lose information - Source the correct shape when possible</li>
				  <li> Images should be relevent, informative, recognizable, convey the right mood and fit the color palette</li>
				  <li> Use plain english, descriptive, keyword-rich file names to help web page ranking and identification.</li>
				</ul>
